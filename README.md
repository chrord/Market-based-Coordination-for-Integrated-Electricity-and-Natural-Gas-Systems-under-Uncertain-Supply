# Market-based Coordination for Integrated Electricity and Natural Gas Systems under Uncertain Supply

This repository contains the supplementary material for the paper "Market-based Coordination for Integrated Electricity and Natural Gas Systems under Uncertain Supply". This is a joint work by Christos Ordoudis, Stefanos Delikaraoglou, Jalal Kazempour and Pierre Pinson.

In this repository, we provide:
   5. The data of the case study and the topology of the networks.
   1. The electronic companion.
   2. The xlsx file that containts the data of the case study.
   
# Electronic companion

This document contains a detailed mathematical description of transforming the original bilevel model in a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), proofs regarding the non-negative profits of flexible producers, additional results and a detailed nomenclature.

# Data file

This file contains the data for the power and natural gas producers, as well as for the electricity and natural gas network. The topology of the systems is also illustrated.
